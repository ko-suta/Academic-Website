#  Does labor flexibility benefit innovation?

.pull-left[
* **Merits** 
  + Easier reallocation to more dynamic sectors
  + More incentives to take risks
  + Job matches ðŸ¢‚ productivity
  + "Fresh blood" inflow
]

.pull-right[
* **Demerits**
  + Stronger labor protection ðŸ¢‚ higher wages and productivity
  + Development of firm-specific skills
  + Trust ðŸ¢‚ productivity
  + Innovation requires long-term incentives, not short-term punishments (Kleinknecht et al., 2014)
]

---
#  Focus & Literature gap 

* Focus on **numerical labor flexibility**
  + "addresses the variation of quantity of labor input" (Arvantis, 2005),
  + reflects the ability of firms to use the external labor market to replace regular employees and/or to use temporary employees on fixed-term and part-time contracts, often through temporary employment agencies? (Kato & Zhou, 2018).
  
* **Literature gap** 
  + previous studies on this topic have mostly concentrated on European cases. Only Kato & Zhou (2018) have recently conducted the study on Japan's startup companies 
  + Kato & Zhou (2018) innovation proxy is a dummy variable (yes/no), mine is the number of applications and citations

#  Methodology 


* **(Sub-) Industries analyzed** 
  + Electricity and Communications ðŸ¢‚ "Semiconductors" 
  + Necessities ðŸ¢‚ "Games"

* **Sources:**
  + The Institute of Intellectual Property Patent Database (IIP-DB): patent application data. Companies having > 5 applications (Lechevalier et al., 2010)
  + Nikkei NEEDS Financial Database: corporate data

* **Innovation proxy (dependent variable)**
  + Patent applications: "represent the development of new and technically feasible devices" (Kato & Zhou, 2018) â€” `quantity aspect` 
  + Patent citations â€” `quality aspect` (Acharya, Baghai et al., 2010)

---

#  Possible conceptualization 

* **Visible innovations** â€” overcoming commoditization along established lines. Value results from function.

* **Invisible innovations** (Kusunoki, 2006)
  + "Rather than boosting existing dimensions, it paints an entirely new picture of how, why, and to whom a new product or service should appeal" (ibid). `Value ~ function` is unclear 
  + "Once a company succeeds in establishing a new product concept, it is often able to produce powerful loyalty and brand effects that trump dimensional superiority" (ibid).
  + Importance of product-customer interaction

* Japan is relatively **weak** in knowledge-based industries. **Gaming industry** as an exception (Aoyama & Izushi, 2003).
* Japan's **dual labor market** ðŸ¢‚ possibility of transition from non-regular to regular employment is only 1.7 to 10.3 percent. **Gaming industry** as an exception (Casper & Storz, 2016).

#  Tentative conclusions 

.pull-left[
* **Semiconductors**
  + Crucial role of `R&D` for innovation, which is linked to `Product Innovation` ðŸ¢‚
  + Negative role of `Process Innovation` ðŸ¢‚
  + `Regulars` (and, possibly, `Non-Regulars`) play an important role ðŸ¢€
  + ðŸ¢€ Positive impact of both **innovation output** (`Patents`) and **innovation input** (`R&D`) on employment
  + `Larger` and `younger` companies are more innovative
]

.pull-right[
* **Games**
  + Important role of `R&D` for innovation
  + Crucial role of numerical labor flexibility, measured as `Non-regulars' share`
  + Investment in fixed assets (ðŸ¢‚ `Process Innovation` ) â€” important for services ðŸ¢‚
  + ðŸ¢‚ Adjustment of `regulars`
  + ðŸ¢€ Negative impact of **innovation output** (`Patents`); positive impact of **innovation input** (`R&D`) on employment
]

---
#  Additional Findings  

+ **Older**  manufacturing firms struggle to innovate (Anderson & Eshima, 2013)
+ **Younger**  manufacturing firms employing **non-regulars** innovate more
+ **Internationalization** is associated with less innovation for manufacturing companies employing **non-regulars**
